CyberFortress Identity Protection Go-to-Market Playbook
The Complete Strategy to Dominate the $35B Identity Protection Market

Version 1.0 | January 2025


Executive Summary
The identity protection market is experiencing a pivotal moment. With 40M+ Americans falling victim to
identity theft annually and 500+ data brokers selling personal information, consumers are desperate for a
comprehensive solution. Current offerings (LifeLock, DeleteMe, IDShield) address only fragments of the
problem.

CyberFortress Identity Protection changes the game by combining automated data broker removal, dark
web monitoring, OSINT investigation capabilities, and quantum-safe encryption into one platform. This
playbook outlines our strategy to capture 10% market share ($3.5B) within 3 years.

Key Success Metrics:

      100,000 customers in Year 1

      $99-$399/month pricing (3x competitor average)
      CAC < $200 with LTV > $8,000
      60% organic growth from viral "disappear" campaigns

      30-day money-back guarantee with <5% refund rate


1. MARKET POSITIONING

1.1 The Identity Crisis Framework

  Current Market Problems:
  ├── Fragment #1: Data Brokers (500+ sites selling your data)
  ├── Fragment #2: Dark Web (Your data already stolen)
  ├── Fragment #3: Identity Theft (40M victims/year)
  ├── Fragment #4: Digital Footprint (Permanent online exposure)
  └── Fragment #5: Future Threats (Quantum computers will decrypt everything)


  CyberFortress Solution:
  ONE PLATFORM → COMPLETE PROTECTION → PEACE OF MIND



1.2 Positioning Statement
For privacy-conscious individuals and families who are concerned about their digital exposure,

CyberFortress Identity Protection is the only comprehensive identity defense platform

That automatically removes you from 500+ data brokers, monitors the dark web, investigates threats
using OSINT, and protects your future with quantum-safe encryption,

Unlike LifeLock (monitoring only), DeleteMe (removal only), or credit monitoring services (financial only),

We provide complete identity protection with military-grade security and the power to "disappear" from
the internet.
